        <h2>Why I love Shrimp alfredo</h2>
        <p> I have always been a fan of shrimp alfredo pasta, it holds a dear place in my heart being one of my
            favourite pasta's and quite frankly the best one in my opinion. personally I like the linguine or
            penne noodle with it, not to mention you could also exchange the shrimp with chicken, personally for choice 
            of preferance.

               <li>Meanwhile the pasta is cooking, prepare the shrimps. Rinse them well and dry with paper towels. Place the shrimps into the bowl and season them with 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp paprika.</li>
                    <li>When time is up, open the lid by using the quick release i.e. turn the valve to the "Venting" position. Remove the noodles from the inner pot and drain them well.</li>
                        <li>Select “Sauté” program, adjust "Mode Indicator" to "More" and set time to 5 minutes. Pour olive oil and add the shrimps. Sauté the shrimps and stir them from time to time. Do not overcook them. Remove the shrimps from the inner pot and set aside.</li>
